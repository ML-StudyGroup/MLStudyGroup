       	  <h3>Welcome to the ML Study Group</h3>
        	<p>We received a lot more replies than we expected, and so had to find a larger venue. Zenaptix have kindly offered to host the events at their premises, located on the R44 between Stellenbosch and Somerset West. We should have plenty of space for everyone.</p>
        	
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>The focus for the first session will be on understanding how simple neural networks relate to classical techniques such as linear regression, and how back propagation (a highly important technique in deep learning) is used to find the model parameters. </p>
        	
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>More details will follow, including a sign up form, what to bring, etc.</p>
            
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We about to get all crazy up in this place, watch this space</p>
			
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My sincerest apologies for this lacklustre page...</p>
